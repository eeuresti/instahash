first official project - Project 1
Out now is the best way to search Instagram! 
Be warned though you might come across some material that may not be suitable for work.

I used an api to do a media search of Instagram.

To make this app work I used a mix of bootstrap, ajax, json, jquery, and underscore. 
At the moment the app is functional but I would like to be able to save the searches which I will be working on. 
I did have some issues with bootstrap in that after I made my site pretty it broke all my code so back to ugly I went.
