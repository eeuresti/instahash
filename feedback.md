##Planning
**√ Wireframes** established w/ jc @ 1:1
**√ User Stories** established w/ jc @ 1:1
**√ ERD** established w/ jc @ 1:1
**√ Research** established w/ jc @ 1:1
**√ Readme** great! Include the above in your readme please

##Creativity
**√ Custom CSS** implemented handrolled CSS over Bootstrap. Good job!
**√ User Flow** user is able to choose from login/signup at splash
**X User Interaction** Buttons below search bar are somewhat cluttered, could use a nice grid system or nav bar implementation.

**Comments** I like the grid layout of the images. Quite dramatic. The simplicity of your site is what makes it more attractive compared to other sites that may offer more functionality.

##Project Workflow
**√ Commit History** 20 commits in 6 days. Looks good. Commit whenever something new works or when something broken is fixed.  Don't forget to push!
**√ Task Management / Prioritization** Some battles with modals may have slowed you down at the start, but afterwards you really showed your true capabilities :)  I'll give you this one this time, but next time, keep it ugly until it works, then add the bells & whistles
**Achieved MVP** Eric did not achieve MVP

##Code Quality
**X Cleanliness** Some code needs to be encapsulated, some needs to be combined for intended functionality
**√ Indentation** I only found a couple indentation swamps. Other than that, looks good.
**√ Clear Names & Comments** good naming convention, comments were clear.
**√ Consistent Style** you like defining things first, which is a great and very helpful habit
**Comments** Need to include a package.json that has your dependencies listed. Also please add bower_components to your .gitignore list.  Makes downloading your app slower than necessary

##Models
**√ 2+ Models** You have two models. One is active on your app.
**X Relationships** Relationships were coded, but undemonstrated on actual app.

##Routes
**√ RESTful API** Uses RESTful conventions
**√ C** Creates User and SearchTerm
**X R** Displays User, NOT SearchTerm
**X U** no update
**X D** no delete

##AJAX
**√ Form submission** fix validation, but otherwise great
**√ Dynamic Updates w/ jQuery** You are using AJAX and there is dynamic updating, but the code has bugs and could use some polishing

##Templating
**X HTML Strings + jQuery** no HTML Strings found
**X Underscore / EJS** no Underscore / EJS
**Comments** Consider using Underscore to display your grid of photos.  EJS is slightly overkill for your app, but it could be used to make consistent headers and footers for your page.

##Auth
**√ Authentication** Good job!
**√ Authorization / Protected Routes** Nice and secure

##Comments
After the Modal Mudpit, you really sprinted for the finish line.  This app looks fantastic in its clean consistency and lack of clutter. You tackled the Instagram API which is no easy task.  Given a few hours of uninterrupted work, I'm confident you could reach and surpass MVP.  You can do this.  You are really close. :)
